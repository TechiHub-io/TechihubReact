## 🔧 Talent Search Route Fix

The issue has been resolved! Here's what was fixed and how to test:

### ✅ **What Was Fixed**

1. **Added Navigation Link**: The talent search route was missing from the dashboard sidebar navigation
2. **Fixed localStorage SSR Issues**: Added client-side checks for localStorage operations
3. **Added Proper Icon**: Used `Users` icon for "Find Talent" in sidebar

### 🚀 **How to Test**

1. **Restart your Next.js development server**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/TechihubReact
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as an employer**

3. **Check the sidebar navigation** - you should now see:
   - Dashboard
   - **Find Talent** ← NEW LINK
   - Post a Job
   - My Jobs
   - Applications
   - Company Profile
   - Messages
   - Settings

4. **Click "Find Talent"** or navigate directly to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/employer/talent-search
   ```

### 🔍 **Alternative Access Methods**

1. **Header Navigation**: Click "Find Talent" in the main header (for employers)
2. **Direct URL**: Navigate directly to `/dashboard/employer/talent-search`
3. **Quick Search**: Use the enhanced search bar in the header

### 🐛 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check your role**: Make sure you're logged in as an employer
2. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh with `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
3. **Check console**: Open DevTools and look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify cookies**: Check that you have the correct `user_role=employer` cookie

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

When you click "Find Talent" or navigate to the route, you should see:
- A comprehensive talent search interface
- Advanced filtering options (skills, experience, location, etc.)
- Profile cards with candidate information
- Search and save functionality
- Real-time search with debouncing

### 📝 **Navigation Flow**

```
Login as Employer → Dashboard → Find Talent (sidebar) → Talent Search Page
```

The route should now work perfectly! The talent search page will load with all the advanced filtering and search capabilities we implemented. 🎉
