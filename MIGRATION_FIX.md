## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Instructions

The error has been identified and fixed. Here's what to do:

### 1. Run the Migration Commands

```bash
cd /path/to/ja-1

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Create migrations
python manage.py makemigrations profiles --settings=techhub.settings.development

# Apply migrations  
python manage.py migrate --settings=techhub.settings.development
```

### 2. Alternative: Use the Fixed Setup Script

```bash
cd /path/to/ja-1
chmod +x setup_search_features.sh
./setup_search_features.sh
```

### 3. What Was Fixed

The issue was in the `SavedSearchViewSet` class - it was missing a `queryset` attribute that Django REST Framework requires for automatic router registration.

**Fixed in**: `/techhub/api/views/saved_search.py`
- Added `queryset = SavedSearch.objects.all()` to the class

### 4. Test the Features

After running migrations successfully:

1. **Start Django server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver --settings=techhub.settings.development
   ```

2. **Start Next.js frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../TechihubReact
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the new features**:
   - Login as an employer
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/employer/talent-search`
   - Try the quick search in the header
   - Test saved searches functionality

### 5. Verify API Endpoints

You can test the new API endpoints:
```
GET    /api/profiles/?search=john&skills=react
GET    /api/saved-searches/
POST   /api/saved-searches/
```

The migration should now work without errors! ðŸŽ‰
