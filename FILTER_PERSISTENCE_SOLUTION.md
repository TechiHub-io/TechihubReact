# Filter Persistence Solution

## Problem
The filter state in the ApplicationsTable component was being reset every time users navigated to an application detail page and came back, because the filters were stored in local component state using `useState`.

## Solution
Moved the filter state from local component state to the Zustand global store, so filters persist across navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ApplicationsTable.jsx
- **Replaced local filter state** with Zustand store filters
- **Added filter conversion** between component format and store format
- **Added visual indicators** for active filters
- **Added clear filters functionality**
- **Auto-expand filters** when filters are active on page load

### 2. Updated Store Persistence (store/index.js)
- **Added filters to persistence** so they survive browser refresh
- **Reset filters** when user changes to prevent cross-user contamination

### Key Features Added

#### Visual Filter Indicators
- Filter button shows "(Active)" when filters are applied
- Filter button changes color when active (green theme)
- "Clear Filters" button appears when filters are active

#### Smart Filter Management
- Filters automatically expand when returning to page with active filters
- All filter operations properly sync with the global store
- Filters are cleared when user logs out or switches accounts

#### Backward Compatibility
- All existing filter functionality preserved
- API calls remain unchanged
- Filter parameters properly converted between formats

## Testing
1. **Apply filters** on the applications page
2. **Navigate to an application** detail page
3. **Navigate back** to applications page
4. **Verify filters are still applied** and data is filtered correctly
5. **Refresh the browser** - filters should persist
6. **Clear filters** using the new "Clear Filters" button

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/applications/ApplicationsTable.jsx` - Main filter persistence logic
2. `src/store/index.js` - Added filter persistence configuration

## Benefits
- ✅ Filters persist across navigation
- ✅ Filters survive browser refresh
- ✅ Better UX with visual filter indicators
- ✅ Easy filter management with clear button
- ✅ Maintains security by resetting filters on user change
