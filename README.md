## Integration Guide

When implementing these endpoints in your frontend application:

1. After login, make a GET request to `/api/v1/user/profile-id/` to retrieve the user's profile ID
2. Store this profile ID in your application state (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
3. Use this ID in all subsequent profile-related requests
4. If the profile doesn't exist yet, the `/api/v1/user/profile-id/` endpoint will create one and return its ID

All profile-related endpoints now use `{profile_id}` in the URL path instead of `me`. This approach provides better RESTful design and avoids the issues with the `/profiles/me/` endpoint.

## Security Notes

All endpoints include security checks to ensure users can only access and modify their own profiles. If a user attempts to access another user's profile, they will receive a 403 Forbidden response or an empty result set depending on the endpoint.
